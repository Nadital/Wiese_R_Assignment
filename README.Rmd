## Leaving the lot of extra information here, for now, just for my own notes.  I'll remove it once I'm done.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# R Assignment Wiese

Inspection, processing, and visualization of data from a paper.

## Data Inspection
1. Initial step is simply copying the necessary files (fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt) to the repository for this project.
2. Second part is just translating the files into objects for R.  Pretty easy to do.  Can then look at stuff like number of rows and columns.

```{r}
fang <- read.csv("fang_et_al_genotypes.txt", sep="\t")
snp <- read.csv("snp_position.txt", sep="\t")
# Dim returns number of rows, then number of columns.
dim(fang)
dim(snp)
```
