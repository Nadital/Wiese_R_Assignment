## Leaving the lot of extra information here, for now, just for my own notes.  I'll remove it once I'm done.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# R Assignment Wiese

Inspection, processing, and visualization of data from a paper.

## Data Inspection
1. Initial step is simply copying the necessary files (fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt) to the repository for this project.
2. Second part is just translating the files into objects for R after getting basic file info.  Pretty easy to do.  Can then look at stuff like number of rows and columns.

```{r}
# Utility functions exist to check file size.
file.size("fang_et_al_genotypes.txt")
file.size("snp_position.txt")
fang <- read.csv("fang_et_al_genotypes.txt", sep="\t")
snp <- read.csv("snp_position.txt", sep="\t")
# Dim returns number of rows, then number of columns.
dim(fang)
dim(snp)
# Size of files makes str() a bit unwieldly, and our fang object is a bit too much for just looking at the header.  Cutting it down a bit on rows and columns helps some, though, and still gives us a decent general idea.  
fang[1:5,1:5]
snp[1:5,1:5]
```
Thus, we see that the filesize for fang_et_al_genotypes.txt is 11054722 bytes, with 2782 rows and 986 columns.  snp_position.txt is 83747 bytes, with 983 rows and 15 columns.
